# Preprint Repository for the Publications by Md Jamal Uddin Khan

This repository contains the preprints of the paper authored or coauthored by me. The objetive is to ensure open access to my scientific contributions to wider community who might not have access to the paid versions of the journals. This is a personal effort to my commitment towards open science. 

Being preprints, not the final formatted manuscript from the journals, it is in my right to share these documents freely. Each document should contain information on when the paper was accepted.
